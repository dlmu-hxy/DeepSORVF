## Introduction
English | [简体中文](README_zh-CN.md)

In this work, we first extract the AIS- and video-based vessel trajectories, and then propose a deep learning-enabled asynchronous trajectory matching method (named DeepSORVF) to fuse the AIS-based vessel information with the corresponding visual targets. In addition, by combining the AIS- and video-based movement features, we also present a prior knowledgedriven anti-occlusion method to yield accurate and robust vessel tracking results under occlusion conditions.
